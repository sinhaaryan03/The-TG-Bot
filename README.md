## Disclaimer

```
///
    Your Telegram account may get banned.
    I am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
    This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
    as well as efficiently managing groups.
    You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
    and you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
    Telegram Team deleted your account?
    And after that, you pointed your fingers at us
    for getting your acoount deleted?
    I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.
   In short, We ain't responsible if you get banned by telegram by your retarded acts

## Read the docs

Here are the most useful "global" variables that can be used on any module you create:

- ENV: A global object which allows access to enviroment variables defined in env.py
- client: A modified version of the telegram client.
- client.storage: A global storage object for the current session.
- events: A simple function that returns a events.NewMessage object.
- progress: Generic progress callback for both uploads and downloads.
- time_formatter: Input time in milliseconds, to get beautified time, as string.
- humanbytes: Input size in bytes, outputs in a human readable format.
- You can learn alot just by reading the telethon [documentory](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/)
- Here is a simple module that adds " world" to the message if you send ".hello".

```
@client.on(events("hello"))
async def handler(event):
	await event.edit(event.text[1:] + " world.")
```

- Enjoy creating your own modules :P
